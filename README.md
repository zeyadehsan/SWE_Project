Habit Tracker
Description: Allow users to set habits or goals and log daily progress towards each.
Skills Practiced: List and class management, progress calculations.
Extensions: Add streak tracking, goal reminders, or progress visualization.
Each idea can grow in complexity, giving you room to practice different aspects of software engineering and Scrum-based iterative development. Let me know if any of these sound good or if you want more details on one!
